### Call us salad cuz we out here dressin - Team Contract

Guidelines:

1.  Respect each other’s ideas and work
    
2.  Make sure to constantly communicate on your part of the project (don’t ignore each others’ messages :( if they relate to you)
    
3.  Be proactive throughout the process and make your best effort to contribute your fair share of the work
    
4.  Let members know before changing or editing their code
    
5.  Let the group know if you need help -- check your ego at the door.
    
6.  If you find yourself having nothing to do at all (i.e. finished your tasks), make an effort to help out other team members out.
    
7.  Observe gitiquette/pull frequently to avoid conflicts, keep master pristine!
    
8.  Act professionally and maturely when conflict arises. Make sure to resolve conflicts between members individually, never in the group-chat. Only involve other group members if necessary (i.e. if a conflict becomes too large or heated to resolve on your own).
    

If any team member breaks any of these guidelines, we may have a team meeting to discuss the issues. If the team member continues to break the guidelines, we may ask Professor Duvall to help find a solution.
